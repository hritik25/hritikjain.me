Despite a lot of uncertainty and turbulence inherent in this year ahead of me, I am looking forward to staying excited, energized and mindfully engaged in working towards the following:

##### Health
- Get to under 150 pounds with 16-18% bodyfat.<br>
_I am starting from 174 pounds with 26-28% bodyfat at the start of the year, and will get to the goalpost by one full steady cut phase followed by one full lean bulk phase_.

##### Work
- Internalize the behaviors of a 10X engineer and get to an L5 role.<br>
_I will demonstrate this by taking a high impact cross-team project from ideation to completion._

##### Social life
- Crystallize stance on marriage.
- Move to a shared apartment.
- Move to an in-person role in work and develop meaningful connections with colleages.
- Volunteer in organizing or leading at least three meetup events.

##### Entrepreneurship
- Publish at least 10 posts on this blog (on any topics)
- Create a product or a service that touches a 1000 lives.

##### Leisure
- Play in a soccer league.
- Complete training of fundamental swimming techniques.


##### Wealth
- Add the first real state investment to portfolio.
