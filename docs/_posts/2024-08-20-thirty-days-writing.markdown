I plan to write a little everyday for the next thirty days. This is motivated by a bunch of intersecting objectives - to experiment with a writing practice, to develop a foundational understanding of investing, and to have a flow activity to wake up to and start the day with. I recently picked up the all-time classic "The Intelligent Investor". I had been reading JL Collins' [stock series](https://jlcollinsnh.com/stock-series/) intermittently for the past couple of days when I found this beauty shoved in a cabinet at my native home (my gracious shelter until the pending move to Canada). Over the years, I have gotten pretty bad at retaining the core ideas from all those educational books I've read. And often I find myself reading books on my phone mindlessly, as the internet has washed away any aesthetic boundaries between legitimate published books and legitimate rubbish. *Writing to retain* as the motto will be my countermeasure to all of that. At least for the next thirty days of reading. And recalling the gist to put it down in my own words will be my countermeasure to getting lazy and using the text verbatim. So for the next thirty days, I am going to chronicle *what I retain* of my readings. Every single day without fail is very idealistic and close to impractical. So we're shooting for never missing twice, and at least five days a week. By the end of reading of this book and the stock series of blogposts, I will have updated my portfolio with the knowledge I *retain*.

#### Day 1 (08/21) - Introduction
I've previously read the book The Psychology of Money. Introduction to The Intelligent Investor to me gives off the same undertone - building wealth in the stock market has not as much to do with raw smarts and mathematical genius as it is do with temperament, and the emotional and psychological discipline to not get lured into speculating about the next decade's FAANG companies. This is comforting to me as a very risk-averse person when it comes to money, but also because this mindset has come handy as an excuse to not dive deep into the potentially boring nitty gritty of securities. But by the same token, it has kept me away from useful financial education on the mechanisms of the market. The Intelligent Investor is exciting in that while it will be covering investment principles and those stock market concepts in detail, the book will address not only defensive, but also *enterprising* investors, rather than simply shunning all active investment. I like that all of the wisdom will be backed with case studies of historical events and patterns. There is a strong emphasis on the distinction between speculation and investment, and so is with the distinction between market price and underlying value. I really liked this analogy with the mental frame of buying groceries vs perfume, 'The really dreadful losses of the past few years (the book's current year is 1971-1972) were realized in those common-stock issues where the buyer forgot to ask "How much?"'

#### Day 2 (08/22) - Investment vs Speculation 1/n
Mr. Benjamin Graham cuts some slack for speculation as he begins this nuanced discussion. There's always a speculative factor in stock prices. Some speculation is, in fact, necessary - the risks of profit and loss of betting on budding stars of their time like Amazon had to be assumed by someone after all, so that they could get off and running. \[This Amazon example was added by commentator Jason Zweig to be clear]. But he warns that speculation is *unintelligent* when you lack the skill for it, you risk more money than you can afford to lose, and/or when you operate on margin. Do it with a small and separate fund if you dare and don't add money to it off-policy. Then he does an elaborate illustration of how the period after 1964 was sort of an exception to the rule when bonds fluctuated more than stocks and their prices went to record high levels. And the intended takeaway is that the future of securities is **never** predictable. Sure, to me though this was an essential push into picking Claude's brain on what is the mechanism with prices of bonds. The ending note for this section is that changes in bond prices are addressed in a later chapter in more detail.

#### Day 3 (08/24) - Investment vs Speculation 2/2
The discussion on bonds vs stocks continues. In the case of comparable taxable return on bonds and stocks - interest for bonds and dividend yield plus annual appreciation for stocks - interest and principal payments on bonds is much better protected money. Accelerated inflation tips the balance in favor of stocks, but commentator Jason Zweig makes a note that TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities), first introduced in 1997, track the Consumer Price Index and immunize this bond's investors. In any event, Benjamin Graham advises, it's not wise to concentrate your investment 100% in bonds. A simple 50-50 division between stocks and bonds or a ratio in the range of 25% to 75% of either is fine. The defensive investor must confine themselves to stocks of the most important profitable companies with long established financial records. They should stick with investment funds (index funds in today's speak) and practice dollar cost averaging.
Then he addresses the enterprising investor, and starts off with rejecting trading as a domain of investment. Investment in this chapter was defined as *an operation, which on thorough analysis, offers safety of principal and a satisfactory return*, and trading is not such an operation. With that off the table, selectivity of stocks with near term or long term projections is quite challenging. Results of the current quarter or year and those predictable for the next one are already factored in the price, as everyone else has picked the same stocks as you.
There can still be stocks that are undervalued simply due to lack of interest or some sort of unjustified yet prevelant prejudice. Buy them you can, but that's one patience-trying experience. Shorting stocks that are overvalued in your opinion, on the other hand, is not for the faint of heart. John Maynard Keynes' famous quote expresses this beautifully, "Markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent." The chapter ends on an encouraging note for the active investors. Amongst the thousands of marketable securities, there must be a fair number of them than can be identified as undervalued by some reasonably dependend standards. \[I guess we'll find out what those standards are later in the book]. Although the effort is only worth it if you can hope to add 5% to your annual return before taxes.

#### Day 4 (08/26) - The Investor and Inflation
This was a small chapter. I learnt that inflation has gone up to as high as 15% in the past. And twice! But the primary point the author is trying to drive home is that inflation has not had a direct impact (in either direction) on stock prices. There was a big section on how inflation is expected to impact stock prices favourably through the way of corporate earnings, but that's has not been the case. I didn't quite get this illustration. Maybe sometime in the future when I'm more knowledgeable. Then he touches upon possible alternatives to stocks as inflation hedges and expresses not being convinced with either gold or real estate. He bashes gold for not returning even as much as interest from a savings account and costing on storage. The commentator references another investment philosopher calling Graham dead wrong about *"precious metals"* on his advice against investing in *"things"*. Their advice is to allocate  a tiny portion, like 2% of your portfolio to gold. When it does poorly, the portion is too small to hurt your portfolio, but in case of spectacular returns it can lift the rest of your otherwise lackluster portfolio by itself. Suggestion for the intelligent investor is to put money in an ETF of sorts dedicated to precious metals with under 1% annual expenses. The author acknowledges his limitation of depth in real estate and leaves it up to the reader to make informed decisions. The chapter ends with putting stocks above bonds nonetheless as a protection against inflation.
