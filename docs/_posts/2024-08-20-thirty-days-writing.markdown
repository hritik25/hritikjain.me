I plan to write a little everyday for the next thirty days. This is motivated by a bunch of intersecting objectives - to experiment with a writing practice, to develop a foundational understanding of investing, and to have an engaging activity to wake up to as I wait out the immigration debacle. I recently I picked up the all-time classic "The Intelligent Investor". I had been reading JL Collins' [stock series](https://jlcollinsnh.com/stock-series/) intermittently for the past couple days when I found this beauty shoved in a cabinet at my native home (my gracious shelter until the pending move to Canada). Over the years, I have gotten pretty bad at retaining the core ideas from all those educational books I've read. And often I find myself reading books on my phone mindlessly, as the boundary between books and rest of the content on the internet has faded. *Writing to retain* as the motto will be my countermeasure to all that, at least for the next thirty days of reading, and writing in my own words will be my countermeasure to getting lazy and using the text verbatim. So for the next thirty days, I am going to chronicle *what I retain* of my readings. Every single day without fail is very idealistic and close to impractical. So we're shooting for never missing twice, and at least five days a week. By the end of reading of this book and the stock series of blogposts, I will have updated my portfolio will what I was taught.

##### Day 1 - Introduction
I've previously read the book The Psychology of Money. Introduction to The Intelligent Investor to me gives off the same undertone - building wealth in the stock market has not as much to do with raw smarts and mathematical genius as it is do with temperament, the emotional and psychological discipline to not getting lured into speculating about the next decade's FAANG companies. This is comforting to me as a very risk-averse person when it comes to money, but also because this mindset has come handy as an excuse to not dive deep into the nitty gritty of securities. But by the same token, it has kept me away from useful financial education on the mechanisms of the market. The Intelligent Investor is exciting in that sense as it will be covering investment principles and those stock market concepts in detail, and also because the book addresses not only defensive, but also *enterprising* investors, rather than simply shunning all active investment. I like that all of the wisdom will be backed with case studies of historical events and patterns. There is a strong emphasis on the distinction between speculation and investment, and so is with the distinction between market price and underlying value. I really liked this line, 'The really dreadful losses of the past few years (the book's current year is 1971-1972) were realized in those common-stock issues where the buyer forgot to ask "How much?"'
