Hey there! Thanks for checking out my blog. I post here from time to time to help myself make sense of the world. Writing on paper has helped me think better. The jury is still out on whether it does with typing on the screen.

A slightly morbid motivation with attaching a post to a date stamp, however, is to get reminded of the shortness of life. That there are only a little more than 500 weeks in a decade. I'd be pleased to get to a double digit number of posts in a given year.
